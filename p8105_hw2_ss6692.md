## Problem 2

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(tidyr)
```

### Loading and cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
mr_trashweel = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx", range = "A2:N550", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel")|>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(trashwheel_name = "mr_trashwheel")|>
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30)|>
  select(-month, -year) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  drop_na()
```

### Loading and cleaning the Professor Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
prof_trashwheel = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx", range = "A2:M97", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel")|>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(trashwheel_name = "professor") |>
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30)|>
  select(-month, -year) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  drop_na()
```

### Loading and cleaning the Gwynnda Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
gwynnda = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx", range = "A2:K110", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel")|>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(trashwheel_name = "gwynnda")|>
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30)|>
  select(-month, -year) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  drop_na()
```

### Merging the three datasets

``` r
trashwheel_tidy = 
  bind_rows(prof_trashwheel, gwynnda, mr_trashweel) |>
  select(trashwheel_name, everything())
```

Using `bind_rows`, I merged the datasets `mr_trashwheel`,
`prof_trashwheel` and `gwynnda` into a cleaned dataset titled
`trashwheel_tidy`. In `trashwheel_tidy`, there are 643 observations and
15 columns. The dataset explores how much trash was collected by the
trash wheels using the variable `weight_tons,` the types of trash
collected, and the number of `homes_powered` using the collected
trash.Using this dataset, we know that Gwynnda Trash Wheel collected 0
cigarette butts. Additionally, we know that Professor Trash Wheel
collected 192.62 tons of trash.

## Problem 3

### Importing and cleaning baseline data

``` r
baseline_data = read_csv(file = "data/MCI_baseline.csv") |>
  janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == "0", "male", "female")) |>
  mutate(apoe4 = ifelse(apoe4 == "0", "non_carrier", "carrier")) |>
  filter(age_at_onset != ".")
```

    ## New names:
    ## Rows: 484 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification
    ## ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: "," chr
    ## (6): ...1, Age at the study baseline, 1 = Male, 0 = Female, Years of edu...
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ
    ## Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## • `` -> `...1`

``` r
  baseline_data$current_age = as.numeric(baseline_data$current_age)
```

I imported the baseline data using `read_csv`. I used
`janitor::row_to_names` to prompt the dataset to ignore the variable
descriptions and use row 2 as the column names. Then, I changed `sex`
and `apoe4` so they are no longer numeric and more descriptive of the
variable. Finally, I used the `filter`function to remove participants
who had no MCI at baseline. Of the 483 participants, 97 develped MCI and
remained in the cleaned dataset. The average baseline age is 65.6113402
years. In this dataset, 60.7843137% of the females are APOE4 carriers.

### Importing and cleaning amyloid data

``` r
amyloid_data = read_csv(file = "data/mci_amyloid.csv") |>
  janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  rename(id = study_id)
```

    ## New names:
    ## Rows: 488 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification
    ## ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: "," chr
    ## (6): Study ID, Time (in years) elapsed since the study baseline to the v...
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ
    ## Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## • `NA` -> `NA...3`
    ## • `NA` -> `NA...4`
    ## • `NA` -> `NA...5`
    ## • `NA` -> `NA...6`

The amyloid data was imported and cleaned similarly to the baseline
data. There are 487 observations and 6 variables. Therefore, there are 4
more participants in the amyloid dataset than in the baseline dataset. I
renamed `study_id` as `id` so we can merge the two datasets in the next
step.

### Merging datasets by participants

``` r
mci_data = 
  inner_join(baseline_data, amyloid_data, by = "id")
```

I merged the data by `id` number so only the participants who appear in
both datasets are present. In this dataset, there are 94 participants.

### Exporting `mci_data` as a .csv

``` r
write.csv(mci_data, file = "data/mci_data.csv")
```
